## About Me

Hi, I'm jooniebb2211!

A dreamer with a deep love for science, data, and the stars.  
Currently navigating my way into the world of Data Science, with a vision to study at Oxford University and work at NASA one day.  
I believe that passion, purpose, and persistence can open any door — no matter how far the stars may seem.

My interests blend the technical and the soulful:  
- Data Science & Machine Learning  
- Astronomy & Space Exploration  
- Creative Coding & Visualization  
- Art, Classical Music, and Philosophy  
- Exploring ancient civilizations & universal mysteries

I’m here to build, learn, and connect — one line of code at a time.
